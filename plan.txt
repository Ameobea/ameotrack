-Get tool to trawl oil price history for a while to provide some form of reference.

--Trading Strategies--
-You can buy both a long and short position (possibly with an adjustable bias towards more long/more short) with high margin.  Open positions RIGHT before oil inventory reports are released.  Set very tight stop lossses on both of them so that such that once the trend becomes apparent, the position on the wrong side of the trend is closed and losses minimized.
